# Overview

A python module for manipulating `.eaf` transcription files (XML) as generated
by the [ELAN](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) linguistic transcription
software. Still highly experimental and unfortunately
[project-specific](http://korpus.cz) (no time to write more general and
optimized code, I'm no python whiz). Please ask if interested in details,
collaboration  or additional features.

# Usage

Please consult source or ask me. The module makes very specific assumptions
about the kind of `.eaf` file it's working with, so chances are it won't be
useful to you. Its main purpose currently is to conver an `.eaf` transcript to
the input format used by [KALDI](kaldi.sourceforge.net).
